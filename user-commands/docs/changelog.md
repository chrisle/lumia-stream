## TRIODE's User Commands
---
Let your viewers create their own custom chat commands! Reward your VIPs and subscribers by using "User Level" permissions so only they can create commands. Anyone in chat can trigger them, making your stream more interactive and fun.

**Example:**
```
TRIODEOfficial: !command add hug @{{displayname}} jumps into @{{message}}'s arms and gives a big hug!
LumiaStreamBot: @TRIODEOfficial Command "!hug" has been created.
Lexie: !hug @TRIODEOfficial
LumiaStreamBot: @Lexie jumps into @TRIODEOfficial's arms and gives a big hug!
```
